            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Maſter Cooks, and to ſuch young Practitioners of the Art of Cookery, to whom this Book may be uſeful.</head>
            <p>TO you firſt, moſt worthy Artiſts, I acknowledge one of the chief Motives that made me to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture this Volume to your Cenſures, hath been to teſtifie my gratitude to your experienced So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; nor could I omit to direct it to you, as it hath been my ambition, that you ſhould be ſenſible of my Proficiency of Endeavours in this Art. To all honeſt well intending Men of our Profeſſion, or others, this Book cannot but be acceptable, as it plainly and profitably diſcovers the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery</hi> of the <hi>whole Art;</hi> for which though I may be <hi>envied by ſome that onely value their private Intereſts above Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and the publick good,</hi> yet God and my own Conſcience would not permit me <hi>to bury theſe my Experiences with my Silver Hairs in the Grave:</hi> and that more eſpecially, as the advantages of my Education hath raiſed me above the <hi>Ambitions</hi> of others, in the converſe I have had with other <hi>Nations,</hi> who in this <hi>Art</hi> fall ſhort of what <hi>I have known experimented by you my worthy Countreymen.</hi> Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the <hi>French by their Inſinuations, not without enough of Ignorance,</hi> have bewitcht ſome of the <hi>Gallants of our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> with Epigram Diſhes, ſmoak't rather then dreſt, ſo ſtrangely to captivate the <hi>Guſto,</hi> their <hi>Muſhroom'd Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:111416:5"/>for Sauce rather then <hi>Diet,</hi> for the <hi>generality</hi> howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever called <hi>A la mode,</hi> not being worthy of taken notice on. As I lived in <hi>France</hi> and had the Language, and have been an eye-witneſs of their <hi>Cookeries,</hi> as well as a peruſer of their Manuſcripts and printed <hi>Authours,</hi> whatſoever I found good in them I have inſerted in this <hi>Volume.</hi> I do acknowledge my ſelf not to be a little beholding to the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Treatiſes, though without my foſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and bringing up under the Generofities and <hi>Bounties of my noble Patrons and Maſters,</hi> I could never have arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to this <hi>Experience.</hi> To be confined and limited to the narrowneſs of a Purſe, is to want the <hi>Materials</hi> from which the <hi>Artiſt</hi> muſt gain his knowledge. Thoſe <hi>Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Perſons my Lord</hi> Lumley, <hi>and my Lord</hi> Lovelace, and others with whom I have ſpent a part of my time, were ſuch whoſe generous coſts never weighed the Expence, ſo that they might arrive to that right and high eſteem they had of their <hi>Guſto's.</hi> Whoſoever peruſes this <hi>Volume,</hi> ſhall finde it amply exemplified in <hi>Diſhes</hi> of ſuch high pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which onely theſe <hi>Nobleſſes Hoſpitalities</hi> did reach to: I ſhould have ſinned againſt their to be perpetuated Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, if I had not ſet down their ſeveral varieties, that the Reader might be as well acquainted with what is extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary as what is ordinary in this <hi>Art;</hi> as I am truly ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that ſome of thoſe things that I have ſet down will amaze a not thorow-paced <hi>Reader</hi> in the <hi>Art of Cookery,</hi> as they are Delicates, never till this time made known to the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fellow Cooks,</hi> that I might give a teſtimony to my <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey</hi> of the <hi>laudableneſs of our Profeſſion,</hi> that I might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage young Undertakers to make a progreſs in the <hi>Practice of this Art,</hi> I have laid open theſe Experiences, as I was moſt unwilling to hide my Talent, but have ever endeavoured to do good to others; I acknowledge that there hath already been <hi>ſeveral Books publiſht,</hi> and amongſt
<pb facs="tcp:111416:5"/>the reſt ſome out of the <hi>French,</hi> for ought I could perceive to very little purpoſe, <hi>empty and unprofitable Treatiſes,</hi> of as little uſe as ſome <hi>Niggards Kitchens,</hi> which the <hi>Reader</hi> in reſpect of the confuſion of the Method, or barrenneſs of thoſe <hi>Authours</hi> Experience, hath rather been puzzled then profited by; as thoſe already extant Authours have trace't but one common beaten road, repeating for the main what others have in the ſame homely manner done before them: it hath been my task to denote ſome <hi>new Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty or Science,</hi> that others have not yet diſcovered; this the <hi>Reader</hi> will quickly diſcern by thoſe <hi>new Terms of Art</hi> which he ſhall meet withal throughout this <hi>whole Volume.</hi> Some things I have inſerted of <hi>Carving and Sewing,</hi> that I might demonſtrate the whole Art. In the contrivance of theſe my Labours, I have ſo managed them for the general good, that thoſe whoſe Purſes cannot reach to the coſt of rich Diſhes, I have deſcended to their meaner Expences, that they may give, though upon a ſudden Treatment, to their Kindred, Friends, Allies, and Acquaintance, a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and reliſhing entertainment in all Seaſons of the year, though at ſome diſtance from Towns or Villages. Nor have my ſerious conſiderations been wanting amongſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for Diet how to order what belongs to the Sick, as well as to thoſe that are in Health; and withal my care hath been ſuch, that in this Book, as in a Cloſet, is contained all ſuch Secrets as relate to <hi>Preſerving, Conſerving, Candying, Diſtilling,</hi> and ſuch rare varieties as they are moſt concerned in the <hi>beſt husbandring and houſewifering</hi> of them. Nor is there any Book, except that of the <hi>Queens Cloſet,</hi> which was ſo <hi>enricht with Receipts</hi> preſented to her <hi>Majeſty,</hi> as yet that I ever ſaw in any <hi>Language,</hi> that ever contained ſo many <hi>profitable Experiences as in this Volume;</hi> in all which the <hi>Reader</hi> ſhall finde moſt of the <hi>Compoſitions,</hi> and mixtures eaſie to be prepared, moſt pleaſing to the pallat, and not too chargeable to the Purſe: ſince you are at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb facs="tcp:111416:6"/>to employ as much or as little therein as you pleaſe. It is impoſſible for any <hi>Authour</hi> to pleaſe all people, no more then the beſt Cook can fancy their pallats whoſe mouths are alwayes out of taſte. As for thoſe who make it their buſineſs to hide their Candle under a Buſhel, to do onely good to themſelves and not to others, ſuch as will curſe me for revealing the Secrets of this Art, I value the diſcharge of mine own Conſcience, in doing good, above all their malice; proteſting to the whole world, that I have not <hi>concealed any material Secret</hi> of above my <hi>fifty years Experience;</hi> my Father <hi>being a Cook,</hi> under whom in my Childhood I was bred up in this Art. To conclude, the diligent peruſer of this <hi>Volume</hi> gains that in a ſmall time as to the <hi>Theory,</hi> which an <hi>Apprenticeſhip</hi> with ſome <hi>Maſters</hi> could never have taught them.

            <head>A ſhort Narrative of ſome paſſages of the Authors Life.</head>
            <p>FOr the better knowledge of the worth of this Book, though it be not uſual, the Author being living, it will not be amiſs to acquaint the Reader with a brief account of ſome paſſages of his Life, as alſo what eminent Perſons (renowned for their good Houſe-keeping) whom he hath ſerved throughout the whole ſeries of his Life; for as the growth of the children argueth the ſtrength of the Parents, ſo doth the judgement and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Artiſt conduce to the making and goodneſs of the Work: now that ſuch great knowledge in this ſo commendable Art was not gained but by long experience, practice, and converſe with the moſt ableſt men in their times, the Reader in this brief Narrative may be informed by what ſteps and degrees he aſtended to the ſame.</p>
            <p>He was born in the year of our Lord 1588. His Father being one of the ableſt Cooks in his time, and his firſt Tutor in the knowledge or practice of Cookery; under whom having attained to ſome perfection in that Art, the old La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Dormer</hi> ſent him over into <hi>France,</hi> where he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed five years, being in the Family of a noble Peer, and firſt Preſident of <hi>Paris;</hi> where he gained not onely the French Tongue, but alſo bettered his knowledge in Cookery: and returning again into <hi>England</hi> was bound Apprentice in <hi>London</hi> to Mr. <hi>Arthur Hollinſworth</hi> in <hi>Newgate Market,</hi> one of the ableſt workmen in <hi>London,</hi> Cook to the Grocers Hall and Star Chamber. His Prenticeſhip being out, the Lady <hi>Dormer</hi> ſent for him to be her Cook under his Father, (who then ſerved that Honourable Lady) where were four
<pb facs="tcp:111416:7"/>Cooks more, ſuch noble Houſes were then keept, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that, and ſhame of this preſent age; then were thoſe golden dayes wherein were practiſed <hi>the Triumphs and Trophies of Cookery,</hi> then was Hoſpitality eſteemed, Neighbourhood preſerved, the Poor cheriſhed, and God honoured; then was Religion leſs talk't on and more pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, then was Atheiſm and Schiſme leſs in faſhion; and then did men ſtrive to be good rather then to ſeem ſo. Here he continued till the Lady <hi>Dormer</hi> died, and then went again to <hi>London</hi> and ſerved the Lord <hi>Caſtle-haven,</hi> after that the Lord <hi>Lumley,</hi> that great lover and knower of Art, who wanted no knowledge in the decerning this myſtery; next the Lord <hi>Mountague</hi> in <hi>Suſſex;</hi> and at the beginning of theſe Wars the Counteſs of <hi>Kent,</hi> then Mr. <hi>Nevel</hi> of <hi>Chriſſen-Temple</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> whoſe Anceſtours the <hi>Smiths,</hi> of whom he is deſcended, were the greateſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of Hoſpitality in all thoſe parts; nor doth the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Mr. <hi>Nevil</hi> degenerate from their laudable examples. Divers other perſons of like eſteem and quality hath he ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as the Lord <hi>Rivers,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Aſhburnham,</hi> of the Bed Chamber, Doctor <hi>Steed</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Stiles</hi> of <hi>Drury-Lane</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> Sir <hi>Marmaduke Conſtable</hi> in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Lucas;</hi> and laſtly the Right Honourable the Lady <hi>Eng! efield</hi> where he now liveth.</p>
            <p>Thus have I given you a brief account of his Life, I ſhall next tell you in what high eſteem this noble Art was with the ancient Romans, <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports that <hi>Lucullus</hi> his ordinary diet was fine dainty diſhes, with works of paſtery, Banquetting diſhes, and fruit curiouſly wrought and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared; and that his Table might be furniſhed with choice of varieties, (as the noble Lord <hi>Lumley</hi> did) that he kept and nouriſhed all manner of Fowl all the year long. To this purpoſe he telleth us a ſtory how <hi>Pompey</hi> being ſick, the Phyſicians willed him to eat a Thruſh, and it being ſaid there was none to be had, becauſe it was then Summer; it
<pb facs="tcp:111416:7"/>was anſwered, they might have them at <hi>Lucullus</hi>'s houſe, who kept both Thruſhes and all manner of Fowl all the year long. This <hi>Lucullus</hi> was for his Hoſpitality ſo eſteemed in <hi>Rome,</hi> that there was no talk but of his noble Houſe-keeping. The ſaid <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports, how <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> inviting themſelves to ſup with him, they would not let him ſpeak with his men to provide any thing more then ordinary; but he telling them he would ſup in <hi>Apollo</hi> (a Chamber ſo named, and every Chamber proportioned their expences) he by this wile beguiled them, and a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was made ready eſtimated at fifty thouſand pence, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Roman penny being ſeven pence half penny Engliſh money; a vaſt ſumme for that Age, before the Indies had overflowed Europe. But I have too far digreſſed from the Author, of whom I might ſpeak much more as in relation to his perſon and abilities, but who will cry out the Sun ſhines: this already ſaid is enough to ſatisfie any but the malicious, who are the greateſt enemies to all honeſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours. <hi>Homer</hi> had his <hi>Zoilus,</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> his <hi>Bavius;</hi> the beſt Wits have had their detracters, and the greateſt Artiſts have been maligned; the beſt on't is, ſuch Works as theſe out-live their Authors with an honourable reſpect of poſterity, whileſt envious Critticks never ſurvive their own happineſs, their Lives going out like the ſnuff of a Candle.</p>

            <p>MAke the likeneſs of a Ship in paſteboard, with flags and ſtreamers, the guns belonging to it of Kickſes, binde them about with pack thred, and cover them with courſe paſte proportionable to the faſhion of a Cannon with Carriages, lay them in places convenient, as you ſee them in Ships of War, with ſuch holes and trains of powder that they may all take fire; place your Ship firm in a great Charger; then make a ſalt round about it, and ſtick therein egg-ſhells full of ſweet water; you may by a great pin take out all the meat out of the egg by blowing, and then fill it with the roſe-water. Then in another Charger have the proportion of a Stag made of courſe paſte, with a broad arrow in the ſide of him, and his body filled up with claret wine. In another Charger at the end of the Stag have the proportion of a Caſtle with Battlements, Percullices, Gates, and Draw-Bridges made of paſteboard, the Guns of Kickſes, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with courſe paſte as the former; place it at a diſtance from the Ship to fire at each other. The Stag being plac't betwixt them with Egg-ſhells full of ſweet water (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) placed in ſalt. At each ſide of the Charger wherein is the Stag, place a Pie made of courſe paſte, in one of which let there be ſome live Frogs, in the other live Birds; make theſe pies of courſe paſte filled with bran, and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed over with ſaffron or yolks of eggs, gild them over
<pb facs="tcp:111416:8"/>in ſpots, as alſo the Stag, the Ship, and Caſtle; bake them, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ace them with gilt Bay leaves on the Turrets and Tunnels of the Caſtle and Pies; being baked, make a hole in the bottom of your pies, take out the bran, put in your Frogs and Birds, and cloſe up the holes with the ſame courſe paſte; then cut the lids neatly up, to be taken off by the Tunnels: being all placed in order upon the Table, before you fire the trains of powder, order it ſo that ſome of the Ladies may be perſwaded to pluck the Arrow out of the Stag, then will the Claret wine follow as blood run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out of a wound. This being done with admiration to the beholders, after ſome ſhort pawſe, fire the train of the Caſtle, that the pieces all of one ſide may go off; then fire the trains of one ſide of the Ship as in a Battle; next turn the Chargers, and by degrees fire the trains of each other ſide as before. This done to ſweeten the ſtinck of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the Ladies take the egg ſhells full of ſweet waters and throw them at each other. All dangers being ſeemed over, by this time you may ſuppoſe they will deſire to ſee what is in the pies; where lifting firſt the lid off one pie, out skips ſome Frogs, which makes the Ladies to skip and ſhreek; next after the other pie, whence comes out the Birds; who by a natural inſtinct flying at the light, will put out the candles: ſo that what with the flying Birds and skipping Frogs, the one above, the other beneath, will cauſe much delight and pleaſure to the whole compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: at length the candles are lighted, and a Banquet brought in, the muſick ſounds, and every one with much delight and content rehearſes their actions in the former paſſages. Theſe were formerly the delights of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, before good Houſe-keeping had left <hi>England,</hi> and the Sword really acted that which was onely counterfeited in ſuch honeſt and laudable Exerciſes as theſe.</p>
